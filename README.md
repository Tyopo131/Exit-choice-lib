# IMPORTANT!
## Do not install the library!
There is currently a massive bug where if the user restarts the program too many times, a memory leak may happen.
I am currently working on fixing this bug. I will announce when the fix has been applied and what version it was applied in.
For now, don't use this library.
I am open to contributions, because that's kind of the point of open source software.
